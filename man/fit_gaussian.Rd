\title{Question 5: Fit Gaussian Model via Maximum Likelihood}
\usage{
fit_gaussian(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}
}
\value{
A list with two named elements:
\describe{
  \item{mean}{The estimated mean of the distribution.}
  \item{variance}{The estimated variance of the distribution.}
}
}
\description{
Computes the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the mean and variance for a Gaussian (normal) distribution.
}
\details{
The mean is estimated as the sample mean. The variance is estimated as the sample variance using MLE,
which divides by \code{n} rather than \code{n - 1}.
}
\examples{
fit_gaussian(c(2.3, 4.1, 3.9, 5.0))
