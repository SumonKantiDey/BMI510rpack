\title{Question 9: Compute Group-Wise Classification Accuracy}
\usage{
fair_accuracy(truth, pred, group)
}
\arguments{
\item{truth}{A binary vector of ground truth labels (0/1 or FALSE/TRUE).}

\item{pred}{A binary vector of predicted labels (same length as \code{truth}).}

\item{group}{A vector indicating group membership (same length as \code{truth}).}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector where each element represents the classification accuracy for a group.
}
\description{
Calculates classification accuracy separately for each group.
}
\details{
This function is useful for evaluating fairness or group-based performance metrics.
Accuracy is defined as the proportion of correctly predicted labels within each group.
}
\examples{
truth <- c(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1)
pred  <- c(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0)
group <- c("A", "A", "B", "B", "B", "B")
fair_accuracy(truth, pred, group)
