\title{Question 2: R function to Adjust and Filter P-values for Multiple Comparisons}
\usage{
adjust_and_filter_p(p_values, method = "holm", alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{p_values}{A numeric vector of raw p-values.}

\item{method}{A string specifying the p-value adjustment method (e.g., "holm", "bonferroni", "BH"). Default is "holm".}

\item{alpha}{A numeric significance threshold to filter adjusted p-values. Default is 0.05.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of adjusted p-values; values that do not meet the alpha threshold are returned as \code{NA}.
}
\description{
Applies a multiple testing correction to a vector of p-values and filters out those that do not meet the alpha threshold.
}
\details{
This function uses \code{p.adjust()} to correct for multiple comparisons and returns adjusted p-values.
Any value greater than \code{alpha} is replaced with \code{NA} to indicate it is not statistically significant after adjustment.
}
\examples{
raw_p <- c(0.01, 0.04, 0.20, 0.03)
adjust_and_filter_p(raw_p, method = "BH", alpha = 0.05)
}
